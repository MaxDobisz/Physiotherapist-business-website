## ü§î Solutions provided in the project

- I used EmailJS to enable users to contact the business directly through the web app. EmailJS is a JavaScript library that allows for sending emails directly from the client-side code, which makes it easy to integrate email functionality into our web application without requiring a back-end server. To ensure that user-submitted emails are valid before being sent via EmailJS, I used the Formik library for email validation.

- I integrated Google Map into the project to display a map of the business location, along with directions for getting there. Google Maps provides a rich set of features that allow users to explore area and nearby points of interest, enhancing the overall user experience of our web application.
